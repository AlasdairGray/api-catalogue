# The list of APIs in the UK Government

This Github API catalogue is for central government and local government APIs. 

If you are working on an API than publishes open data or connects government with other organisations, industry or consumers, then we’d like to invite you to publish details of it in this catalogue by submitting a Github Issue. 

Collecting a list of government APIs will help us understand: what APIs are published and where API development is taking place; and whether APIs are suitable for reuse. 

If you have any questions, please contact:
