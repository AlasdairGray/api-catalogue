Ambulance data is information relating to emergency calls (999, 111 and others), received at an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and processed into a Computer Aided Despatch (CAD) system, including: 

call details

response details - including response times and episode outcome times patient

contact details - including patient demographics, patient response details, patient information, injury information, patient assessment, medication, observations, diagnoses, conveying outcome, safeguarding and public health information

 You can: 

post ambulance data individually or in batches

 You cannot: 

read any of the records stored in DPS

 The API is asynchronous - when you submit data, it acknowledges receipt without validating or processing the data first. To receive error notifications, you need to use MESH. The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end process:  The following describes the end-to-end process: 

The ambulance trust system sends the ambulance data to the Ambulance Data Submission API.

The Ambulance Data Submission (ADS) API forwards the ambulance data to our Data Processing System (DPS).

If there is an error, DPS sends an error notification to MESH.

The ambulance trust system retrieves the error notification from MESH.

An ADS User views the ambulance data in our NHS Digital ADS Dashboards.

The NHS Digital ADS Dashboards get the ambulance data from DPS.

Use this integration to support transfer of care from hospital to social services for patients with care and support needs, as described in the Care Act 2014. It enables the exchange of structured information between hospitals and social care organisations.

You can send:



hospital assessment notices to inform social services that an assessment of a patient's care and support needs is required

hospital discharge notices to confirm a patient's proposed discharge date

withdrawal notices to withdraw a previous assessment or discharge notice



You can also send an admissions notice with this integration so a hospital can inform social services that a patient has been admitted.

This is a messaging integration which uses MESH to send and receive messages.

Information Standard SCCI2075 defines the minimum data sets that you must use for Assessment, Discharge and Withdrawal (ADW) notices. For additional message guidance on the implementation and use of ADW FHIR messages and some divergences from this ADW Information Standard, see Assessment Discharge and Withdrawal - FHIR API.

Use this messaging integration to receive bowel cancer screening test results in primary care GP systems from the screening system, specifically faecal occult blood test (FOBT) results.

This integration uses UN/EDIFACT based messages sent over MESH.

Also known as NHS004 messages, these are a simpler version of the NHS003 messages specified in the Pathology EDIFACT v1.003 Standard but with the changes specified in 'Electronic GP Communication Requirements for GPSoC Software Suppliers Draft', under 'Additional guidance' below.

Bowel cancer screening NHS004 messages are almost the same as pathology NHS003 messages except they are much simpler in structure, with a single SNOMED code and 5 result values.

If you are building a system to receive bowel cancer screening test results, you can use our Lab Results adaptor to receive these EDIFACT results via an easy-to-use FHIR-compliant format. 

Before you begin any development work using this integration, contact us to discuss your best options.

Use this API to access Child Protection - Information Sharing (CP-IS), the national electronic database of child protection information.

The API can be used by local authorities and unscheduled care providers as follows:  



Local authorities

As a local authority, you can:



upload a patient's CP-IS information

receive a notification when the patient's CP-IS information is accessed from an unscheduled care setting

receive a notification of an inactive NHS number



Local authorities originally used a CP-IS client to transfer CP-IS data from their children’s social care systems to CP-IS via the Spine. This was replaced by the MESH client which all local authorities now use to exchange information with CP-IS - see connections 1 to 4 on the diagram.

Unscheduled care providers

As an unscheduled care provider, you can:



get a patient's CP-IS information - which automatically triggers a notification to the relevant local authority - see connections 5 and 6 on the diagram



Scheduled care providers

CP-IS is not currently available for use in scheduled care settings.

Information held in CP-IS

CP-IS holds the following information for each registered patient:



NHS number

details of their plan - type, start date and end date

details of the 25 most recent CP-IS information accesses from unscheduled care settings in England

the name of the responsible local authority - together with their office hours phone and emergency duty contact numbers



Identifying patients

All records in CP-IS are held against the patient's NHS number. It is therefore very important to ensure you use the correct NHS number for each patient.

For more details, see CP-IS NHS number matching information.

Using SCRa as an interim measure

We prefer unscheduled care providers to integrate their applications directly with CP-IS using our CP-IS APIs. However, as an interim measure, you can use our Summary Care Record application (SCRa) to access CP-IS information.

Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP) options

There are also commercially available products which give easier access to CP-IS, known as Spine Mini Service Providers (SMSPs).

These and other conforming software products are listed in our Conformance Catalogue.

If you are interested in becoming a provider of one of these products, see Child Protection - Information Sharing - SMSP API standards.

get a patient's COVID-19 test history, based on their NHS number with an optional specific date range

 You cannot currently use this API to: 

get details of other types of test

 You get the following data: 

COVID-19 test event details

 Data availability, timing and quality All test records are verified to ensure the NHS number is correct before making them available via the API. In most cases this is automatic, and the record is available within 48 hours of the test event, sometimes sooner. In a very small number of cases, we are unable to verify the NHS number, and we do not make the test record available at all.

Use this API to access a wide range of live lists of reference data with our Data Registers Service which includes historic data. Each register is managed by a custodian across a range of organisations. In each case, they represent the approved version of that data. 

Examples of these data registers include:



organisation codes

postcodes

diagnosis codes



You can see what data registers are available using our data registers tool.

If you're looking for richer functionality from a data source, such as being able to test data validity, extract a subset or map data across different schemas then take a look at our Terminology Server - FHIR API - the terminology server provides a richer view of the SNOMED data set only. This also conforms to the international FHIR standards for its APIs.

If your use case requires historical, point-in-time snapshots of reference data, they are available either from this API or the TRUD API. ",https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/data-registers-service-rest,,https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support,,,,NHS Digital

Use this batch message integration to submit a file of patient information to the Spine for tracing against the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) for direct care purposes.

The service is provided for organisations that do not want to write their own software - typically NHS trusts or local authorities.

It returns a limited set of PDS data items, as for PDS SMSP.

It requires PDS access approval before you can use it.

You can:



install a DBS client in a secure location, for example in a server room not a desktop PC

download and complete the DBS End Point Registration form (see interactions below) and submit it to the DBS Implementation Team at [email protected]. You should receive endpoint information within 7 days.

submit a test file to DBS to confirm connectivity over Secure FTP

use the DBS client to submit batch trace requests and receive batch responses to them

Use this integration to share information about a child's health between healthcare workers.

This information is recorded throughout a child's clinical pathway or patient journey about:



health events

clinical contacts 



These events or contacts happen either as part of:



a planned Healthy Child Programme

unplanned GP or Emergency Department visits



Examples of such events include creating, updating or deleting a record of a:



blood spot test outcome

newborn hearing test

Newborn and Infant Physical Examination (NIPE) outcome



This integration uses a publish-subscribe model - the sending system publishes events to National Events Management Service (NEMS), and NEMS forwards the events to all subscribed systems via MESH.

Subscribed systems might be GPs, emergency departments, local authorities or some other care provider. Potentially, patients and carers could also share this information.

This API is also known as the Spine Security Broker (SSB), and is part of the NHS Care Identity Service (CIS).

You can:



access the Identity Server which serves up SSO Tokens and manages the sessions for users who have been successfully authenticated

access the Identity Agent on the end user's workstation, which mediates the authentication transaction and serves subsequent user information on demand as part of the application's authorisation process

access the Client Signing Interface, which provides client-side digital signing functions for the purposes of Content Commitment. This interface primarily uses cryptographic functions that execute on a user’s smart card.



Users can only be authenticated if they are formally registered on the Spine. This includes creating a user profile, stored in the Spine Directory Service (SDS), containing the user’s roles and other information that the Registration Authority or Service deems necessary to make appropriate data access decisions.

This authentication service makes use of smartcards to provide strong authentication for health care workers to control access to national services. It is being replaced by NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2), which provides additional authentication methods for scenarios where a smartcard might not be preferred or appropriate.

 Accredited system records Every system that connects to the Spine has one or more “Accredited System” (AS) records in SDS, identified by an Accredited System Identifier (ASID).

This ASID is unique to a system deployed in a specific organisation, so the same application deployed into three NHS organisations would typically be represented as three unique ASIDs. MHS records and endpoints Every GP Connect system also has one or more “MHS” records (or message handling server record), identified by Party Key and Interaction ID.

MHS records of GP Connect provider systems contain the endpoint of the target practice, as defined by the FHIR service root URL.

Please see System topologies for more details on the allocation of ASIDs and Party Keys. 

For all intermediary messaging endpoint lookups, this API returns the NHS Digital Spine MHS endpoint address.
