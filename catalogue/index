<h1 id="apis-in-the-uk-government">APIs in the UK government</h1><p>This API catalogue is for central government and local government APIs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working on an API that publishes open data or connects government with other organisations, industry or consumers, weâ€™d like to invite you to publish details of it in this catalogue. You can publish details of your API by submitting a <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/api-catalogue/issues">GitHub Issue</a>.</p>
<p>Collecting a list of government APIs will help us understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>what APIs are published</li>
<li>where API development is taking place</li>
<li>whether APIs are suitable for reuse</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact: <a href="mailto:api-standards-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">api-standards-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>

<ul>

<li>an internal-only REST API built using Flask to manage services, users, templates, etc (this is what the admin app talks to)</li>
